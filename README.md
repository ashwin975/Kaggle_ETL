# Azure-Unity-Catalog-Project

## Introduction:
- In this project, I have executed an end-to-end ingestion and transformation pipeline based on Databricks [Medallion Framework](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/medallion-architecture). The project aims to demonstrate the seamless integration of Azure services with Unity Catalog, facilitating efficient data processing and analysis.

🥉 Bronze: Initial Ingestion of the raw data as External tables stored in Delta lake format
  
🥈 Silver: Initial Transformation of the raw data as Managed tables stored in Delta lake format

🥇 Gold: Final transformation of the raw data as Managed tables stored in Delta lake format. 

The resulting Managed tables stored in Delta lake format represent the curated dataset ready for comprehensive analysis.
